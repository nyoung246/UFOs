# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to assist Dana in providing a more in- depth analysis of UFO sighting by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The criteria included Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. This website was created using Javascript, while HTML, CSS and Bootstrap were used for the designs.

## Results: 
Please see the below steps for how the user should use the filtering process.
1.	When the user enters the website, it should look like the below image. The website should show the banner at the top, a body of text with its header, followed by filters on the right and documented UFO sights on the left.

2.	The user will then locate the filters shown in the below image. They can then search the UFO sightings by Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

3.	As an example below, I have entered “bonita” in the city criteria. On the right, all UFO sightings in the City of Bonita will be filtered and the results will be shown. The criteria entered must be an exact match with no spaces, spelling errors or capitalized letters.

## Summary:

A drawback of this design is that the user will have to search by the exact results. If any of the criteria are entered with a space, spelling error or capitalized letters, then no results will be shown. This does not make the website user friendly, and the user will likely not return. 

Two additional recommendations are shown in the following points:

•	 Addressing the issues from the above point, update the filter functions to be more user friendly. Allowing the user to input spelling errors, capitalized letters and spaces; this should still show the same results. And also changing the “Date” criteria from entering date, month and year, to just month and year. This allows the user to search for broader results as an individual date may be too specific. 
 
•	When there are truly no results, there should be a message saying “No Results Found” to ensure the user that the search action has been completed.
